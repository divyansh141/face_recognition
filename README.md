# INTRODUCTION
I have created a Face Recognition Program under guidance of Mr. Vimal Daga Sir. This Program will be used to detect face.

# My Setup:
I have used Jupyter Notebook to write this code.

# How it Works:
I have used VGG16 model to create a face recognition model. First of all you have to scan your face to store your face's data. This data will be used to recognise your face.
And that's it. Now train your model and test it. It is now ready to recognise your face in no seconds.
